A wise man can learn more from his enemies than a fool from his friends.
Do, or do not. There is no “try”
Every man dies, but not every man really lives.
Great men are not born great, they grow great.
It’s what you do right now that makes a difference.
If you focus on what you left behind, you will never be able to see what lies ahead.
It is not our abilities that show what we truly are… it is our choices.
I belive whatever doesn't kill you, simply makes you stronger
Get busy livin, or get busy dying
To call you stupid would be an insult to stupid people!
 Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, and today is a gift.
